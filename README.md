# Loan_eligibility_prediction
## LOAN-APPROVAL-PREDICTION-PYTHON


# Overview

This project leverages machine learning to predict loan approval based on historical data. The training dataset, "loan-train.csv," is used to train models, and predictions are made on the "loan-test.csv" dataset.

# Requirements
- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn
- Installation

# Installation
1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/hemanthnutakki/Loan_eligibility_prediction.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
   cd Loan_eligibility_prediction
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
# Model Training
The notebook includes the training of two machine learning models: Decision Tree and Naive Bayes.

# Loan Approval Prediction for Test Data
After training the models, the notebook predicts loan approval for the test data (loan-test.csv) and outputs the results.

# File Descriptions
Loan_Prediction.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data exploration, preprocessing, and model training.
loan-train.csv: Training dataset.
loan-test.csv: Test dataset.
# Results
The notebook provides accuracy scores for both the Decision Tree and Naive Bayes models. Additionally, it predicts loan approval for the test data and outputs the results.
